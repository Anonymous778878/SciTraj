We observe that significant challenges in transferring its high performance in the language domain to the visual domain can be explained by differences between the two modalities. One of these differences involves scale. Unlike the word tokens that serve as the basic elements of processing in language Transformers, visual elements can vary substantially in scale, a problem that receives attention in tasks such as object detection  [42, 53, 54] . In existing Transformer-based models  [64, 20] , tokens are all of a fixed scale, a property unsuitable for these vision applications. Another difference is the much higher resolution of pixels in images compared to words in passages of text. There exist many vision tasks such as semantic segmentation that require dense prediction at the pixel level, and this would be intractable for Transformer on high-resolution images, as the computational complexity of its self-attention is quadratic to image size. To overcome these issues, we propose a generalpurpose Transformer backbone, called Swin Transformer, which constructs hierarchical feature maps and has linear computational complexity to image size. As illustrated in Figure  1 (a), Swin Transformer constructs a hierarchical representation by starting from small-sized patches (outlined in gray) and gradually merging neighboring patches in deeper Transformer layers. With these hierarchical feature maps, the Swin Transformer model can conveniently leverage advanced techniques for dense prediction such as feature pyramid networks (FPN)  [42]  or U-Net  [51] . The linear computational complexity is achieved by computing self-attention locally within non-overlapping windows that partition an image (outlined in red). The number of patches in each window is fixed, and thus the complexity becomes linear to image size. These merits make Swin Transformer suitable as a general-purpose backbone for various vision tasks, in contrast to previous Transformer based architectures  [20]  which produce feature maps of a single resolution and have quadratic complexity.", "sentences": ["To overcome these issues, we propose a generalpurpose Transformer backbone, called Swin Transformer, which constructs hierarchical feature maps and has linear computational complexity to image size."], "derivation": {"method": "substring_grounding+gap_merge+paragraph_expand", "gap_chars": 350, "expand_to_paragraph": true, "section_priority": ["introduction", "abstract", "conclusion"]}}

Shifting the mask tokens to the small decoder in our asymmetric encoder-decoder results in a large reduction in computation.

Looking at the Voltron objective, a natural question to ask is why we chose language generation over masked language modeling. Furthermore, recent and concurrent work propose learning multimodal masked autoencoders (M3AE) both within and outside of robotics  [Geng et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2022] , showing promising results in learning visual representations for image classification tasks, amongst others. To assess the differences, we choose to reproduce the M3AE model in a manner similar to our reproduction of MVP and R3M; we keep the same Something-Something-v2 pretraining data, adopting the exact procedure described in  Geng et al. [2022] , then evaluating the resulting representations on the same subset of evaluation domains as in the prior ablation (third row of Table  4 ). Surprisingly, we see drastic drops in performance across the board. Looking at the pretraining curves, we identify a possible reason for this failure: in optimizing M3AE on Sth-Sth, we see the language modeling loss go to zero almost immediately, leading to overfitting. A possible explanation is that the masked language modeling conditioned on visual contexts in datasets annotated with short, predictable narrations leads to degenerate representations, while generative language modeling is not susceptible to the same types of collapse; looking at ways to mitigate this seems like a promising direction for future work. Explicit details around pretraining and evaluating R-M3AE, with an in-depth discussion are in §C.2. the 22M in the ViT-Small).

Therefore, we encourage all conferences to include such standards in their submission process. Unfortunately, our results suggest that submitting the code alone does not seem to be enough, as the released code does not meet a minimum requirement for reproducibility, defined as achieving the results reported in the paper using the provided source code. We believe it is time to improve reproducibility standards to address the concerns we raise in regards to quality of the released source code. In particular, we strongly suggest shifting the focus from source code to research artifacts which include (1) a self-contained runtime environment (e.g., a Docker container or a VM image) with scripts for achieving every single result reported in the paper, (2) smaller experiments to quickly validate the integrity of the artifact, and (3) extensive documentation explaining how to run the code. We took a first step in this direction by packaging all the results in the paper in their own artifact, and releasing it with this paper.
